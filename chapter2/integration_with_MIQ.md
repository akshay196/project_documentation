## Integration of OpenStack with ManageIQ

After the entire installation and configuration of OpenStack provider,
It must be integrated with ManageIQ.

ManageIQ can manage a variety of external environments, known as
providers and managers.

A provider or manager is any system that ManageIQ integrates with for
the purpose of collecting data and performing operations.

### Add OpenStack Provider

So here we choose OpenStack for this integration as we are basically
working for Infrastructure-as-a-Service.

To add a provider in ManageIQ, We need to login to ManageIQ dashboard.

Navitage to **Compute &rarr; Clouds &rarr; Providers** and then go to
**Configuration &rarr; Add a New Cloud Provider**. This will land you on a
new screen where you need to provide information about the provider to
be integrated.

- Give a name of the provider to add.

- Choose type as "OpenStack" platform from the type list.

- Select a API version of your OpenStack  provider's Keystone service
  from the list. The default is Keystone v2.

- Next is to select a zone for a provider. Choose whichever is
  appropriate. By default, it is default.
-
- By default Tenant Mapping is Disabled but you need to enable it.

Provider](../images/chapter2/Add_OpenStack_Provider.png "Add OpenStack
Provider")

- In the Endpoints section, There are two tabs i.e. Default and Events.

In Default tab, We need to configure the host and authenticate  details
of OpenStack provider.

- To authenticate the provider, Select a security protocol method. SSL
  allows you to authenticate the provider securely using a certificate
authority.

- Enter the hostname or IP Address either IPv4 or IPv6 of the provider.

- In API port, OpenStack uses 5000 port by default.

- Fill in the credentials in Username and password field. The usrename
  must be privileged and its corresponding password.

| Note |In OpenStack platform, You will get the password in keystonerc_admin file in /root directory.|
|------|:------|

- Validate the details to make sure that ManageIQ can connect to
  OpenStack provider.

Provider-Default_Tab](../images/chapter2/Add_OpenStack_Provider-Default_Tab.png
"Add OpenStack Provider - Default Tab")

In Events tab under Endpoints section, We need to configure how ManageIQ
should receive events from the OpenStack provider.

- If you prefer to use AMQP messaging bus, Select AMQP event service.
  For this you need to set the public port used by AMQP in API Port and
the corresponding credentials. Also validate the credentials to confirm
them.

- If you want to use Telemetry service by the OpenStack provider, Select
  Ceilometer event service.

| Note |To use Ceilometer service you must configure the *notification_driver*. To do so edit the *etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf* and set `store_events = true` |
|------|:------|

OpenStack Provider - Event Tab")

Here your cloud provider is successfully integrated with ManageIQ. All
the instances, images, networks, security groups, etc. are summarized
here. It also displays the machine status with its last session details.

| Note |It takes time to integrate the cloud provider and display all its details.|
|------|:------|

![Fig 4-OpenStack Summary](../images/chapter2/OpenStack_Summary.png
"OpenStack Summary")

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent infrastructure
providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which
display basic information about each provider:

1 Number of hosts<br>
2 Management system software<br>
3 Currently used<br>
4 Authentication status

You can walk through all these things by just clicking on it.

### Issue Faced

We faced a issue after the integration of the OpenStack provider. Even
after the integration, the details and information of OpenStack provider
like instances, images, network, etc were not displayed.

But later we discovered that there were compatibility issues of *Fog
Library* in the OpenStack provider with ManageIQ and fog is the Ruby
cloud services library to talk to OpenStack clouds.

So it was a need to change the OpenStack version so we downgraded the
OpenStack-Pike to OpenStack-Ocata.

And later on everything went on smoothly.
