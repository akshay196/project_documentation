# Embedded Ansible

In ManageIQ after release Fine, Ansible is embedded within ManageIQ
itself. Before Fine release, automation was supported in ManageIQ but we
had to write a Ruby script which uses custom domain.

Since Fine release automation has been easier in way that we just need
to write Ansible playbooks. Embedded Ansible provides integrity to run
Playbooks.

After the integration of OpenStack provider with ManageIQ, It is the
time to enable *EmbeddedAnsible* Server Role in Server Controls of
ManageIQ.

1. Navigate to **Administrator|EVM &rarr; Configuration**. This will land
   you on the screen of *Server Settings*.

2. Enable the EmbeddedAnsible server role.

3. Click the Save button to carry forward the changes.

Role")

| Note |This will take some time depending on the internet speed and appliance specifications.|
|------|:------|

ManageIQ will generate events about EmbeddedAnsible activation in
notification section.

You can check the status of the task in ManageIQ by navigating to
**Administrator|EVM &rarr; Tasks &rarr; All Tasks tab**.

You can also check that whether the EmbeddedAnsible role has started or
not by `vmdb; rake evm:status`.

| Warning |If the Server Role is not started, do check the `log/evm.log` and `log/automation.log` files after execution of `vmdb`.|

### Add Repository

After the EmbeddedAnsible Server role has successfully started, we need
to move ahead to add a git repository of playbooks.

1. Navigate to **Automation &rarr; Ansible &rarr; Repositories** .

2. Walk to **Configuration &rarr; Add New Repository** .

3. Give an appropriate name to the repository.

4. Add a short description about what the repository is exactly.

5. Choose the SCM type from the drop down list. By default, it is Git.

6. Enter the URL of the repository to be added. In our case, we have
   used a playbook that helps you create a instance, network, group, etc
in OpenStack. Refer
[this](https://github.com/psachin/openstack-ansible-inside) link for the
playbook.

7. Add the SCM credentials from the drop down list whichever is
   appropriate.

8. SCM Branch field should be filled with the name of the branch.

9. Check the appropriate box for any SCM Update Options.

10. Click on Add button to save the changes.

Repository")

Once the repository has been added successfully. You can see the files
is the playbook in ManageIQ dashboard itself.

It shows all the information regarding the repository like the name,
time, status, playbooks, etc. You can easily walk through it on a single
click.

### Issue Faced

The installation of ManageIQ - Fine was done with the integration of
OpenStack Cloud provider but after enabling EmbeddedAnsible Server role,
we faced a issue for not starting that role and generation of lots of
events.

Later after checking the `evm.log` file we encountered that to setup
embedded ansible we need enterprise licence in ManageIQ - Fine release
as it uses Ansible Tower for automation.

But as we didn't had any so we upgraded ManageIQ to its latest stable
release Gaprindashvili-1 which use AWX. AWX is open source version of
Ansible Tower.

So we shifted to ManageIQ - Gaprindashvili with the integration of
OpenStack.
